## Overview

This repo aims to collect translations of the code examples from the paper "Why Functional Programming Matters"
in various programming languages. Currently we have a Java example.

## Why this repository exists

The paper's introduction starts as follows:

> This paper is an attempt to demonstrate to the larger community of (nonfunctional)
programmers the significance of functional programming,

However, the notation with which the source code in the paper is written (Miranda), while terse and very similar to
Haskell, can be offputting.
As it happens, people who need to be convinced that functional programming matters, are often times people who are
put off by mathematical notation. :)

Therefore I start an effort to translate the code examples to languages that aspiring functional programmers-to be
will be familiar with.

The initial goal is to have a 
* Java implementation based on [Functional Java](https://github.com/functionaljava/functionaljava)
* Javascript-based implementation using something reasonable (lodash / ramdajs / immutablejs )

## Java implementation

* Delivered with the help of the excellent FJ library.
* You need Java 8 and Gradle to compile and run
